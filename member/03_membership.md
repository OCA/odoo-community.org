We do have several membership levels which imply various levels of participation in the association. Read the [FAQ](../04_faq.html) to know more about how to participate. Send your membership request by fulfilling and sending [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uYhoEga_Lc-kUDobRpNP09L4lTHqya51ZlyZPlh31Eg/viewform).

Have a look [here](member_list.html) to have the actual list of member.

## Categories

There are three categories of individual affiliation with the OCA: Participant, Member, and Charter Member.

### Participant

The broadest category, that of Participant, is for those who are not formally registered on the OCA website but who nonetheless contribute code, help out by giving opinion, follow the various mailing lists, ... Anyone can be a Participant.

### Member

The second category is called Member. Individuals in this category have the same level of rights to work on OCA activities as the Participant category, but with the important distinction that these individuals are member of the OCA, they pay their contributions. 
By being a member, an individual is "opting in" and publicly acknowledging their connection to the OCA. This membership process also provides the OCA with a known, countable membership base. For example, the Board or various Committees may, from time to time, wish to poll the all Members on some important issue.

### Charter Member

The third category is Charter Member. Individuals in this category have the same rights as the above Member category, but with two important differences. Firstly, individuals in this category are not self-selected, but rather must be voted into this category by the other Charter Members. Secondly, individuals in this category have the right to vote in elections for other Charter Members, and for Board Members.

*These two factors are intended to maintain the integrity of the Foundation election processes -- and by extension the integrity of the Foundation itself. We use the term "Charter" Member to explicitly indicate that these members are responsible for upholding the "charter" of the Foundation.*

*Without the Charter Member category to serve as a basis for the Board election process, it would be technically possible for a group of self-interested Members to "hijack" the Board and hence the Foundation itself, turning it away from our basic goals and principles.*

*We emphasize that the only real difference between a Member and a Charter Member is the right and responsibility to vote at the Foundation level. It is not our intent to make the Charter Members out to be some "privileged" class. Furthermore, the only real difference between a Member and a Participant is the self-registration on the Foundation's website. All mailing lists, projects, committees, and other Foundation activities are uniformly open and available to all friends of the Foundation.*
