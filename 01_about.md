## The OpenERP Community Association

The OpenERP Community Association, or OCA, is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to support the collaborative development of the OpenERP features, and to promote the widespread use of OpenERP. The association provides financial, organizational and legal support to the broader OpenERP Open Source community. It also serves as an independent legal entity to which community members can contribute the code, the funding and other resources, with the knowledge that their contributions will be maintained for public benefit.

The association's projects are all freely available and useable under an OSI-certified Open Source license.

Our goals :

+ Help and promote the collaborative software development of OpenERP;
+ Encourage the development of OpenERP and its features while coordinating and organizing the collaborative work on the software;
+ Assist the community while defending its interests and the sustainability of its developments;
+ Promote the use of the OpenERP solution;
+ Facilitate synergies, collaborations and fund raising efforts;
+ Actively collaborate on the definition of the roadmaps of new versions of the tool and their implementation.
