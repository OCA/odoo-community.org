## Structure and Governance

### What is the OpenERP Community Association ?
The association, or "OCA" for short, is an independent nonprofit legal entity established to support the needs of the open source OpenERP community. The association will serve as an organizing body, a public technology commons, a development community manager, and event sponsor. Once fully established, the association will provide a legal and administrative framework to better support the ongoing development and promotion of OCA's projects. 

### What is the legal form of the association ?
The association is a membership-based organization incorporated under the laws of association, Switzerland. The association was expressly incorporated as a not-for-profit organization.

### Who owns/controls the association?
The association is a nonprofit entity and has no shareholders. Thus, nobody "owns" the association. However, the association does have charter members who, like the shareholders in a for-profit company, elect the association's board of directors. The board of directors, acting together, manages the affairs of the association. 

### Who are the members ?
The membership is composed from users, supporters, promoters, and developers of open source OpenERP software. Becoming a member is as easy as joining the site and contributing to the association goals. Beyond members, there are various charter members. 

### Can I become a charter member?
New charter members are nominated and elected by existing charter members during the annual charter member election. 

### Can a regular member have any influence?
Yes! First, a regular member can do everything a charter member can do, except vote in board elections. They can speak up, and contribute in every way. The association aims to be a do-acracy, and so the way to have influence is to do things! Ultimately, of course, the association will only succeed in its mission if the entire community gets involved -- so please don't hesitate! We need your help! 

### Who are the board of directors?
The Board of Directors were voted in an initial round by the initial association membership and then by the elected association members.

### Is the association controlled by OpenERP SA?
No. OpenERP has provided generous support to help establish the association, and some of their people may be part of the association in the future as anybody else.

### What are the detailed rules of governance of OCA?
OCA is governed by a board of directors elected by the charter members. The board selects a President, Treasurer and Secretary as officers with particular areas of responsibility. 

Projects are operated by Project Steering Committees which select a chair or board liaison who is designated an officer of OCA after confirmation by the board. The board also designates some special purpose committees responsible for particular areas with a chair who is an officer. Typical committees and projects operate fairly autonomously and largely by consensus. However, as needed, the board can step in to address issues inconsistent with the goals and responsibilities of OCA. By virtue of their selection of the board and new charter members, the charter membership are the ultimate authority at OCA.

## Project and Module Joining the Association

### What software projects are currently part of the association?
On its formation, tthe most representativ work has been achieved by the former community organization. See the [OCA's Projects](projects.html) for an official list. 

### What does a project or Module need to join?
Projects (or module) need to go through the vote of charted member to join the association. Details on how to apply, and how the process works are available on the [OCA's Projects](projects.html) page. 

### So when can my project join?
Only a limited number of projects (and modules) can be effectively handled be the OCA at a time, so please be patient. 

### Do OCA's projects and related devs need to sign over copyright to the association?
Yes. The individual contributions in OCA's projects are expected to grant the Copyright to the association. At the creation of the association, all projects were not in that case and followed a review process.

### Do project developers need to sign a legal agreement?
No. Generally speaking this is not required, but all committer (as part of the [communtiy reviewer team](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer) and their [related teams](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer/+participation)) 

 some specific projects may require developers or their employers to sign a contributor agreement.

Do association projects need to turn over project control to the association?
No. The association is not interested in controlling association projects. However, association projects are expected to follow some association rules, mostly around the need to ensure that project code is not legally encumbered (e.g., not stolen, or improperly contributed), and that appropriate controls are in place to ensure code is properly contributed. Some additional expectations may exist around projects operating in an open and accountable fashion, handling association-provided funding appropriately and not taking actions that will cause legal problems or negative goodwill for the association. The association also encourages, but does not require, projects to support association goals, such as implementing standards-based interoperability. 

Can my project operate as a benevolent dictatorship?
OCA projects are typically governed by a Project Steering Committee (PSC). The PSC should operate openly and with a consensus based approach. While the PSC may delegate specific responsibilities to particular project members it is ultimately intended to be the governing body for the project. A benevolent dictatorship is not considered a suitable open and consensus based approach to governance. 

Do I have to use mandated source control / web system / bug system / mailing list from the association?
No. Projects joining the association can continue to use their traditional source control system, web site system, bug tracker and mailing list software. However, the association does offer these infrastructural components, and encourages their use to provide a more consistent way for users and developers to interact with the different association projects. 

Does the association mandate a particular license for software?
The association only accepts projects that use OSI-certified licenses for their software, and requires that projects stick to OSI-certified licenses. This includes common licenses such as MIT/X, BSD, GPL, and LGPL. The association encourages library projects to use the LGPL or a more permissive license (such as MIT/X or BSD) rather than the GPL so that the libraries can be reused by non-GPL projects, but does not require it. The association also discourages a proliferation of new and incompatible licenses. 

Does the association mandate a particular license for content other than software, such as geodata, educational materials, documentation, etc.?
The association accepts non-software projects that use Creative Commons or similar licenses for their public geodata, educational material, or promotional material. The association also discourages a proliferation of new and incompatible licenses. 

## Participation


To be part and start contributing to our organization, you can easily sign up to our [mailing lists](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community) on Launchpad. This is the first step to starts discussion with others, exchanging ideas, keep you inform, etc.. This i completely free and no need to sign any agreement.

What can I do to get involved?
Visit the OCA web site. Join the main association discuss list. Check out the Volunteers Needed wiki. You don't need to be a programmer. 

How can I contribute code?
The governance model currently being formulated will define the legal and related issues concerning how code will be accepted into association software projects. Individual Project Steering Committees will determine the criteria for accepting contributions within this broader legal framework. In the meantime, you are encouraged to participate on the mailing lists for the association projects. 

Does the association need money?
The association is soliciting organizational sponsorships now. Once some organizational and financial details are worked out it will also be possible for individuals to make tax deductible (if in the USA) donations. However, contributions of time for committee work, development, documentation, testing, user support, and advocacy are the preferred form of contribution from individuals. Some countries have tax exempt organizations with similar goals to OCA that may be candidates for donations or that are willing to receive donations for OCA. 

May I used the OCA logo and name freely?
Yes, but the association considers the OCA name, and logo to be trademarks, so please review the trademark guidelines and FAQ. The logos page has logos in a variety of styles and formats.
