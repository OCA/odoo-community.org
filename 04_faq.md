## Structure and Governance

### What is the OpenERP Community Association ?
The association, or "OCA" for short, is an independent nonprofit legal entity established to support the needs of the open source OpenERP community. The association will serve as an organizing body, a public technology commons, a development community manager, and event sponsor. Once fully established, the association will provide a legal and administrative framework to better support the ongoing development and promotion of OCA's projects. 

### What is the legal form of the association?
The association is a membership-based organization incorporated under the laws of association, Switzerland. The association was expressly incorporated as a not-for-profit organization.

### Who owns/controls the association?
The association is a nonprofit entity and has no shareholders. Thus, nobody "owns" the association. However, the association does have charter members who, like the shareholders in a for-profit company, elect the association's board of directors. The board of directors, acting together, manages the affairs of the association. 

### Who are the members ?
The membership is composed from users, supporters, promoters, and developers of open source OpenERP software. Becoming a member is as easy as joining the site and contributing to the association goals. Beyond members, there are various charter members. 

### Can I become a charter member?
New charter members are nominated and elected by existing charter members during the annual charter member election. 

### Can a regular member have any influence?
Yes! First, a regular member can do everything a charter member can do, except vote in board elections. They can speak up, and contribute in every way. The association aims to be a do-acracy, and so the way to have influence is to do things! Ultimately, of course, the association will only succeed in its mission if the entire community gets involved -- so please don't hesitate! We need your help! 

### Who are the board of directors?
The Board of Directors were voted in an initial round by the initial association membership and then by the elected association members.

### Is the association controlled by OpenERP SA?
No. OpenERP SA has provided generous support to help establish the association, and some of their people may be part of the association in the future as anybody else.

### What are the detailed rules of governance of OCA?
OCA is governed by a board of directors elected by the charter members. The board selects a President, Treasurer and Secretary as officers with particular areas of responsibility. 

Projects are operated by Project Steering Committees which select a chair or board liaison who is designated an officer of OCA after confirmation by the board. The board also designates some special purpose committees responsible for particular areas with a chair who is an officer. Typical committees and projects operate fairly autonomously and largely by consensus. However, as needed, the board can step in to address issues inconsistent with the goals and responsibilities of OCA. By virtue of their selection of the board and new charter members, the charter membership are the ultimate authority at OCA.

## Projects and Modules Joining the Association

### What software projects are currently part of the association?
On its formation, the most representative work has been achieved by the former community organization. See the [OCA's Projects](02_projects.html) for an official list. 

### What does a project or Module need to join?
Projects (or modules) need to go through the vote of charted member to join the association. Details on how to apply, and how the process works are available on the [OCA's Projects](02_projects.html) page. 

### So when can my project join?
Only a limited number of projects (and modules) can be effectively handled be the OCA at a time, so please be patient. 

### Do OCA's projects and related developements need to sign over copyright to the association?
Yes. The individual contributions in OCA's projects are expected to grant the Copyright to the association. At the creation of the association, all projects were not in that case and followed a review process.

### Do project developers need to sign a legal agreement?
No. Generally speaking this is not required, however, all the committers (as part of the [community reviewer team](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer) and their [related teams](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer/+participation)) must have signed one. For more details, please read the [CLA](cla/cla.html) page.

### Do association projects need to turn over project control to the association?
No. The association is not interested in controlling association projects. However, association projects are expected to follow some association rules, mostly around the need to ensure that project code is not legally encumbered (e.g., not stolen, or improperly contributed), and that appropriate controls are in place to ensure code is properly contributed. Some additional expectations may exist around projects operating in an open and accountable fashion, handling association-provided funding appropriately and not taking actions that will cause legal problems or negative goodwill for the association. The association also encourages, but does not require, projects to support association goals, such as implementing standards-based interoperability. 

### Can my project operate as a benevolent dictatorship?
OCA projects are typically governed by a Project Steering Committee (PSC). The PSC should operate openly and with a consensus based approach. While the PSC may delegate specific responsibilities to particular project members it is ultimately intended to be the governing body for the project. A benevolent dictatorship is not considered a suitable open and consensus based approach to governance. 

### Do I have to use mandated source control / web system / bug system / mailing list from the association?
No. Projects joining the association can continue to use their traditional source control system, web site system, bug tracker and mailing list software. However, the association does recommend to use Launchpad to provide a more consistent way for users and developers to interact with the different association projects. 

### Does the association mandate a particular license for software?
The association only accepts projects that use OSI-certified licenses for their software, and requires that projects stick to OSI-certified licenses. This includes common licenses such as MIT/X, BSD, GPL, and LGPL. The association encourages library projects to use the AGPL rather than the GPL, but does not require it. The association also discourages a proliferation of new and incompatible licenses. 

## Participation

### What can I do to get involved?
Visit the OCA web site. Join the main [community list](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community). You don't need to be a programmer. You can also request your membership by fulfilling and sending [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uYhoEga_Lc-kUDobRpNP09L4lTHqya51ZlyZPlh31Eg/viewform).

### How can I contribute code?
The governance model currently being formulated will define the legal and related issues concerning how code will be accepted into association software projects. Currently, you can submit your merge proposal on any of the related OCA's project. It'll be reviewed by the team owner and the community reviewer team. The copyright must be granted to the OCA, more details [here](cla/cla.html).

### How can I be part of the reviewer team?
To be accepted in one of the team, start by suggesting merge proposals and reviewing others' work. When significant work has been achieved, you can apply for the team by requesting your membership on the [community reviewer mailing list](mailto:openerp-community-reviewer@lists.launchpad.net ).

### Does the association need money?
The association is soliciting organizational sponsorships now. However, contributions of time for committee work, development, documentation, testing, user support, and advocacy are the preferred form of contribution from individuals. 

### May I used the OCA logo and name freely?
Yes, but the association considers the OCA name, and logo to be trademarks.
