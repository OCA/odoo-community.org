Introduction
============

This code of conduct applies to all interactions between people 
under the Odoo Community Association (OCA) official communication channels,
such as the official mailing Lists, Github projects, Discord server) 
- also referred to as "lists", as well as behavior in OCA's organized events.

The OCA's official communication channels and events are for enthusiastic people 
who want to have constructive discussions about Odoo and the Odoo Community Association.

As the channels are public and open to all, this code of conduct aims to ensure a quality discussion for everyone.
The channels are not systematically reviewed by OCA representatives.
While you will see responses from OCA representatives from time to time,
there are other support channels available if you require an official response.


We Strive To:
============


1. Be friendly and patient
--------------------------

If someone asks for help it is because they need it. 
Politely suggest specific documentation or more appropriate venues where appropriate.
Avoid aggressive or vague responses.

We are volunteers, who are doing this in their spare time out of enthusiasm,
and want to do so in a  positive and friendly environment.
Negative behaviors and non-constructive criticisms will be moderated,
because they take away the fun of the participants and also scare away new volunteers.


2. Be civil and considerate
---------------------------
  
Disagreement is no excuse for poor conduct or personal attacks.
A community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive nor welcoming one.


3. Assume good faith
--------------------
  
Remember that technical questions may be very complex.
If you disagree, please do so politely, by disputing factual premises rather than by attacking individuals.

If something seems outrageous, check that you did not misinterpret it. 
Ask for clarification, rather than assuming the worst.


4. Respect time and attention
-----------------------------
  
Community members are busy people. So, we value concision and clarity.
Communication that is brief and to the point takes more time to write,
but is repaid many times over when other members of the community make the same effort.

Avoid talking about the same topics several times, or hijacking other’s threads.

Try to provide extra valuable information or a question in every reply.


5. Respect the topics
---------------------
  
Conversations should remain focused and on-topic.
If you must change the topic, start a new thread by changing the topic line of your emails or messages.
Avoid flooding the channel with long threads by reading the entire thread first,
instead of responding quickly to many messages in a short period of time.

You can not use these channels to

* advertise services,
* do commercial offers,
* discuss software other than Odoo or Odoo related.

Don’t use the list to report copyright or licenses infringements,
report issues to legal@odoo-community.org instead.


6. Don't feed the trolls
------------------------

Don’t get involved in flame wars. Neither post nor respond to incendiary material.

If you should find yourself in a disagreement with one person,
make your responses to each other over email
rather than continue to send messages to the list or the group.

Avoid sending messages or posting articles which are no more than gratuitous replies to replies.


Enforcement
===========

Experienced members of the Odoo Community Association comply with this code,
not because of the existence of the code, but because they have long experience
participating in communities where the conduct described above is normal and expected.

However, failure to observe the code may be grounds for reprimand, probation, or removal from the lists.

If you have concerns about someone’s conduct:

Direct contact: it is always appropriate to direct message a channel member,
mention that you think their behavior was out of line, and (if necessary) point them to this document.

Moderators: You can reach out to the Odoo Community under coc@odoo-community.org
